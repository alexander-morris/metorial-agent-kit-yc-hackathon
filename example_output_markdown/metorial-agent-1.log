I've completed the comprehensive research of the Metorial API based on the existing documentation in your project. The research compiled includes:

**✅ All Available Endpoints:**
- `/memories` - CRUD operations for memory storage
- `/memories/search` - Search with query and semantic options  
- `/memories/batch*` - Batch operations for bulk processing
- `/sessions` - Session management and streaming
- `/files` - File upload, search, and retrieval

**✅ Authentication Methods:**
- Bearer token authentication
- Secret keys (`metorial_sk_*`) for server-side
- Publishable keys (`metorial_pk_*`) for client-side

**✅ Request/Response Formats:**
- JSON payloads with structured schemas
- FormData for file uploads
- URL parameters for search queries
- Server-Sent Events for streaming

**✅ TypeScript/JavaScript Code Examples:**
- Complete client implementation classes
- Framework integrations (Express, React, FastAPI)
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Performance optimization patterns

The research file would be created at `/Users/almorris/yc-hack-metorial/metorial-fresh-api-research.md` once you grant write permissions. All the API research has been thoroughly completed based on the existing comprehensive documentation in your project files.
