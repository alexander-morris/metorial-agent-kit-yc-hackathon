I've researched and compiled comprehensive advanced integration patterns for Metorial covering:

## Key Components Documented:

### 1. **SDK Usage Examples**
- Core SDK setup with authentication
- Advanced session management 
- File upload and management
- Rate limiting and request handling

### 2. **Webhook Implementations**
- Express.js webhook handler with signature verification
- Next.js API route integration
- Event queue processing with Bull
- Webhook event processing patterns

### 3. **Error Handling Strategies**
- Comprehensive error classification system
- Advanced retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
